## Three Insights and Light Bulb Moments

### 1. My operational background is an advantage

Coming from a completely different industry, I've sometimes wondered if my operational experience (and corresponding lack of technical experience) was an advantage. But this week I realized it's actually one of my biggest assets, my wife has experienced the same thing in going from operations to tech. The ability to think in operational and business terms means I can build better tools and data products for the leaders who actually need them.

There was a line in our conversation that really clicked for me: "the fanciest insights and elegant architecture means nothing if it doesn't solve a real business problem." That's exactly why I'm here. I've been on the operational side. I know what questions matter and what decisions need to be made, as well as how frustrating it can be to not have the tools or information you need to make the right decision. That perspective is valuable, and I need to stop second-guessing it.

### 2. I don't have to figure everything out alone

The struggles I've had over this first year transitioning into data work it turns out are pretty common. The industry has already developed solutions to a lot of these problems, but I won't find them if I keep grinding away in isolation.

I have this tendency to just try and figure things out on my own, but taking the time to actually talk through issues—with people or even with AI—has been surprisingly powerful. It takes the edge off the frustration and usually gets me unstuck faster than hours of solo troubleshooting would. I need to get comfortable asking for help earlier in the process. That being said, the struggle is part of the learning as well. Maintaining that balance is key for my learning style. 

### 3. I might be optimizing the wrong things

There's a good chance I'm spending too much time making things work or making them look pretty, and not enough time understanding what story the data is actually telling. I can get caught up in perfecting a dashboard or wrestling with syntax when I should be stepping back and asking: what problem am I actually solving here? How could I solve it better?

Going forward, I need to lead with the "why" before I dive into the "how." A rough answer to the right question beats a polished answer to the wrong one.

## What's Next

I'm going to start each project by writing down the problem I'm solving and what success looks like. And when I hit a wall, I'm going to reach out sooner rather than later. The goal isn't to become a pure technician—it's to bridge the gap between business problems and data solutions. That's where I can add real value.
